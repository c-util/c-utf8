c-utf8 - Standalone UTF-8 Implementation in Standard ISO-C11

ABOUT:
        The c-utf8 project is a standalone implementation of UTF-8 in
        Standard ISO-C11.

        To use UTF-8, include c-utf8.h and link to the libcutf8.so
        library. A pkg-config entry is provided as well.

REQUIREMENTS:
        The requirements for c-utf8 are:

            libc (e.g., glibc >= 2.16)

        At build-time, the following software is required:

            meson >= 0.41
            pkg-config >= 0.29

INSTALL:
        The meson build-system is used for c-utf8. Contact upstream
        documentation for detailed help. In most situations the following
        commands are sufficient to build and install c-utf8 from source:

            $ mkdir build
            $ cd build
            $ meson setup . ..
            $ ninja
            $ ninja test
            # ninja install

        No custom configuration options are available.
